  * Combines 'content' and 'style' from two images. Cost function with two components - content and style. 
  * Content is captured in higher layers of the network (VGG used; with max-pool changed to avg-pool for better gradient flow), while Style is captured throughout the network.
  * Style is calculated as 'Gram matrix', which is basically element-wise sumproduct between (two at a time) channels of a layer
  * Start with a white noise image, and modify it using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
